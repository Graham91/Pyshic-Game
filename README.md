# Pyshic-Game
What the project does: this project is a game where you hit a key on your key board and if it the correct key you get a point in the win row.
you have nine guess to get it right after which you get a point in the lose row.
each time you win or loose the guesses reset and you can start over trying to guess the letter.
the consule will tell you what the correct letter should be and it will tell you if won or lost as well.

Why the project is useful: Its a really fun way to pass the time although the no conection dino is clearly better.
